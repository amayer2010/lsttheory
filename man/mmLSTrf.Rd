  nTime = 2,

\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame.\cr 
This data frame contains only the indicator variables which will be used to 
fit the MM-LST-RF model. For more information about the required data 
structure refer to the function details.
The first indicator & the first method will be used as reference indicator & 
reference method across occasions and fixed situations.}

\item{nSit}{Integer. Default = 2.\cr 
Number of fixed situations. Must be >= 2.
Used to calculate the number of Trait Factors (TF).}

\item{nTime}{Integer. Default = 2.\cr 
Number of time-points. Must be >= 2. 
Used to calculate the number of Occasion Factors (OF).}

\item{nMth}{Integer. Default = 2.\cr 
Number of methods. Must be >= 2.
Used to calculate the number of Trait-Method Factors (TMF) & Occasion-Method
Factors (OMF).}

\item{structural}{Character string. Default = \code{"TF"}.\cr
Adds structural part to the model. Can be one of the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{"none"} estimates only the measurement model.
\item \code{"TF"} models Person x Situation interactions. The TF from fixed 
situation s = 1 serves as reference to be contrasted against. \code{TFcov} will be 
set to \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{"TMF"} models Method x Situation interactions. The TMF from fixed 
situation s = 1 serve as references to be contrasted against. Only TMF of the 
same indicator i and method m will be contrasted across situations.\code{TFcov} 
will be set to \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{"both"} models both Person x Situation & Method x Situation interactions
modeled. \code{TFcov} and \code{TMFcov} will be set to \code{FALSE}.
}}

\item{includeOMF}{Logical. Default = \code{TRUE}.\cr 
If \code{TRUE}, OMF will be estimated. 
If \code{FALSE}, no OMF will be estimated. 
Can be used when only small or no occasion-method effects are expected.}

\item{lat.cov}{List. Default = \code{FALSE}.\cr 
Specifies covariances between latent variables.
\itemize{
\item \code{TFcov}. If \code{TRUE}, covariances between all TF will be estimated. 
Will automatically be set to \code{FALSE} if \code{structural = "TF" || "both"}.
If \code{FALSE}, no covariances between TF will be estimated.
\item \code{OFcov}. If \code{TRUE}, covariances of OF with their respective 
counterparts in other fixed situations will be estimated (e.g., Cv(O21,
O_22), Cv(O_21,O_23) and Cv(O_22, O_23)). 
If FALSE, no covariances between OF will be estimated.
\item \code{TMFcov}. If \code{TRUE}, covariances between all TMF will be estimated. 
Will automatically be set to FALSE if \code{structural = "TMF" || "both"}.
If \code{FALSE}, no covariances between TMF will be estimated.
\item \code{OMFcov}. If \code{TRUE}, covariances of OMF with their respective 
counterparts in other fixed situations will be estimated.
If \code{FALSE}, no covariances between OMF will be estimated.
}
It is recommended to estimate covariances sparingly (especially for TMF) as 
this quickly inflates the amount of free model parameters. 
For the estimation of only a select number of covariances, specifications 
can be passed to the function via the \code{"addsyntax"} argument.}

\item{meanstructure}{Logical. Default = \code{FALSE}.\cr 
If \code{TRUE}, model will be estimated with a meanstructure. 
If \code{FALSE}, model will be estimated without a meanstructure.}

\item{meas.invar}{Character string. Default = \code{"time.invar"}.\cr
Measurment invariance assumptions across groups. Can be one of the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{"time.invar"} = assumes time invariance of indicator loadings + intercepts
across occasions.
\item \code{"metric.m"} assumes time invariance & equal loadings across methods. 
\item \code{"metric.s"} assumes time invariance & equal loadings across fixed situations.
\item \code{"metric.b"} assumes time invariance & equal loadings across methods & fixed 
situations. 
\item \code{"scalar.m"} assumes time invariance & equal loading + intercepts across 
methods.  
\item \code{"scalar.s"} assumes time invariance & equal loading + intercepts across 
fixed situations. 
\item \code{"scalar.b"} assumes time invariance & equal loading + intercepts across 
methods & fixed situations.
\item \code{"residual.m"} assumes time invariance & equal loading + intercepts + error 
variances across methods.  
\item \code{"residual.s"} assumes time invariance & equal loading + intercepts + error 
variances across fixed situations.
\item \code{"residual.b"} assumes time invariance & equal loading + intercepts + error 
variances across methods & fixed situations.
}}

\item{equiv.ass}{List. Default: TF = \code{"par"}, OF & OMF= \code{"ess.equiv"}.\cr
Equivalence assumptions for latent variables.
For TF, OF & OMF the following equivalence assumptions can be made separately 
for each latent variable:
\itemize{
\item \code{"cong"} for congeneric measures makes no restrictions apart from setting the
loading of the first indicator of the latent variable to 1 and the intercept 
to 0 for identification purposes.
\item \code{"ess.equiv"} for essentially equivalent measures assumes equal loadings of
all indicators of the latent variable.
}
For TF the following additional equivalence assumptions can be made:
\enumerate{
\item \code{"equiv"} for equivalent measures assumes equal loadings + intercepts of all 
indicators of TF.
\item \code{"ess.par"} for essentially parallel measures assumes equal loadings + error 
variances of all indicators of TF.
\item \code{"par"} for parallel measures assumes equal loadings, intercepts + error 
variances of all indicators of TF.
} 
No equivalence assumptions need to be specified for TMF since they are defined 
as residual latent variables and all loadings are automatically fixed to one 
due to the combination of identification requirements and time invariance.}

\item{addsyntax}{Character string.\cr
Optional argument where additional model specifications, such as covariances
between specific TMFs and TFs, can be passed to the function in standard lavaan
notation and will automatically be added to the generated lavaan syntax.
For more information about the used variable notation refer to the function 
details.}

\details{
\strong{Data Structure:}\cr
The order of the indicators Y_imts (i = indicator, m = method, t = time-point
/occasion, s = fixed situation) need to match the following format:
Y_1111, Y_2111, Y_1211, Y_2211, Y_1121, Y_2121, Y_1221, Y_2221, Y_1112, etc.
This format reflects the order of indicator variables in a path diagram where
indicators are first grouped by fixed situations, within those they are then
grouped by occasions and within those they are lastly grouped by methods. 
The resulting nested structure has indicators nested within methods, nested
within occasions, nested within fixed situations.

The number of fixed situations, occasions (time-points), methods and number 
of indicators can take any value >= 2.
However, the model is restricted to an equal number of indicators for each 
method, occasion and fixed situation. For example, if method A has 3 
indicators, method B must also have 3 indicators. Accordingly, if 
there are 2 methods with 3 indicators each, every  occasion will have 6 
indicators (3 from each method).  
In the same vein, the number of methods needs to be equal across occasions 
and the number of occasions needs to be equal across fixed situations. 
Lastly, only one Trait Factor is estimated per fixed situation.
