\title{Dataset mmLSTrf_exampledata.}
\format{
A data frame with 500 rows and 36 variables
}
\description{
A simulated dataset illustrating data for a study design with 2 fixed 
situations, 3 measurement occasions, 2 methods and 3 indicators.
}
\details{
The variables are named after the following format: \eqn{Y_{imts}}
(i = indicator, m = method, t = occasion, s = fixed situation)
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{Y_{1111}}
  \item \eqn{Y_{2111}}
  \item \eqn{Y_{3111}}
  \item \eqn{Y_{1211}}
  \item \eqn{Y_{2211}}
  \item ...
  \item \eqn{Y_{2132}}
  \item \eqn{Y_{3132}}
  \item \eqn{Y_{1132}}
  \item \eqn{Y_{2232}}
  \item \eqn{Y_{3232}}
}

This format reflects the order of indicator variables in a path diagram, where
indicators are first grouped by fixed situations, within those they are then
grouped by occasions and within those they are lastly grouped by methods. 
The resulting nested structure has indicators nested within methods, nested
within occasions, nested within fixed situations.

The specified population values underlying the simulated data are: 
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{E(T_{111})} = 2.90
  \item \eqn{Comm(T_{112})} = 0.74
  \item \eqn{E(T_{112})} = 3.50
  \item \eqn{\epsilon_{imts}} = 0.15
  \item \eqn{Var(T_{111})} = 0.40
  \item \eqn{\alpha_{ims}} = 0.00
  \item \eqn{Var(T_{112})} = 0.98
  \item \eqn{\lambda_{ims}} = 1.00
  \item \eqn{Var(O_{11t1})} = 0.20
  \item \eqn{\delta_{ims}} = 1.00
  \item \eqn{Var(O_{11t2})} = 0.35
  \item \eqn{\gamma_{ims}} = 1.00
  \item \eqn{Var(TM_{ims})} = 0.10
  \item \eqn{\beta_{1112}} = 0.35
  \item \eqn{Var(OM_{mts})} = 0.10
  \item \eqn{\beta_{0112}} = -0.21
  \item \eqn{Var(\omega_{11s})} = 0.20
  }
Trait factors are essentially parallel, other latent variables are essentially 
equivalent. Scalar MI holds across fixed situations and methods. Latent 
variables are orthogonal apart from trait factors.
